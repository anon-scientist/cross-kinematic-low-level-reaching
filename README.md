# Kinematic Low-Level Reaching Benchmark (LLR-K), part of the CRoSS benchmark suite
This repository contains the kinematic variant of the Low-Level Reaching environment from the CRoSS suite.
In this version, robot motion is computed analytically using forward and/or inverse kinematics, without requiring the Gazebo simulator.
The kinematic setup preserves the same observation, action, and reward structure as the physically simulated environment, but runs significantly faster, making it suitable for rapid prototyping, algorithm development, and hyperparameter tuning.
The full simulated version and additional benchmarks are linked from the main [CRoSS](https://github.com/anon-scientist/continual-robotic-simulation-suite/) repository.

Upon acceptance of the paper, we will make the full public version of this project available under our official organization account.*

## Overview
The Low-Level Reaching (LLR) benchmark evaluates continual reinforcement learning using joint-level control of a simulated 7-DoF robotic arm.
Instead of issuing Cartesian end-effector motions, the agent directly selects joint angle targets for each of the seven arm joints.
An episode consists of exactly seven steps, one for each joint in sequence, after which the final end-effector position is compared to the task’s goal position.

The action space is discretized per joint: for each joint, a fixed number of discrete angle targets is derived by evenly dividing that joint’s allowable motion range.
This creates a combinatorial action structure that requires effective exploration to discover good joint configurations leading to the desired end-effector pose.

This repository provides the kinematic version of the LLR benchmark, where robot motion is computed analytically from forward kinematics.
This approach removes the need for physics simulation or message transport, while preserving identical observations, actions, and reward definitions to the physically simulated version, resulting in a substantial speed-up for experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.

The benchmark consists of eight tasks, each defined by a distinct 3D target position positioned around the robot at different heights and orientations.
The agent must learn joint configurations that place the end-effector at these targets, despite the sparse reward structure and the sequential joint-control constraint.

## Requirements
-   icrl repository
-   cl_experiment repository
-   Apptainer software
-   icrl/icrl.def for building the container

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository in a folder, where all other required repositories will be cloned into!!!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anon-scientist/cross-kinematic-low-level-reaching
```
2. Clone both the icrl and cl_experiment repositories from the requirements above.
(Run these where you want them to end up in your file system)
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/anon-scientist/icrl
git clone https://github.com/anon-scientist/cl_experiment
```
3. Create the Apptainer container from the `icrl.def` file in the icrl repository.
```bash
cd icrl
apptainer build ../my_container.sif icrl.def
cd ..
```
4. (Optional) Modify the cmd line parameters in `main.bash` of this repository to what you want to test.
5. Run the `main.bash` by executing it with the apptainer image.
    * change "path_to_benchmark_repo" to the path where you cloned the repository into (including its name)
    * Make sure that the image has execute permission for the `main.bash`
```bash
apptainer exec my_container.sif path_to_benchmark_repo/main.bash
```
6. Look at the simulation results located in a new results folder inside the cloned repository
